## Expansion Offline Mode
 
**Thank you to Arkensor for his Offline Mode, for without this this Offline editor would not be possible.**

This Offline Mode Valning offers the ability to edit, or explore the world of DayZ in a singleplayer environment on the Valning Map. While this mode does not represent the actual DayZ gameplay, it offers other possibilites for developers, content creators and playerS who do want to experiment around but not loose all their progress from online.

This is UNOFFICIAL, so don't blame the DayZ development team if this is not working at all for you! This source combines functionality of the DayZ Expansion Mod with Avoka's Valning Map. 

## Installation
The source of this map must be installed under your ```Steamapps\Common\DayZ\Missions``` directory. You must also have the following mods installed:
* Community Framework (CF)
* Community Online Tools (COT)
* DayZ-Expansion
* DayZ-Expansion-Licensed
* BuilderItems
* BuilderStatics

To launch the game in Offline Mod, simply run the ```DayZCommunityOfflineMode.bat``` file in ```Steamapps\Common\DayZ\Missions\ExpansionCOM.Valning``` to start the game. 

If you run into an error after launching the included ```DayZCommunityOfflineMode.bat```, copy the ```BuilderItems``` and ```BuilderStatics``` from ```!dzsal``` to ```!Workshop``` and launch the bat file again.

**Even though this is not directly bannable by Battleye, just to make sure: Rename your Battleye folder to Battleye.disabled, and rename the DayZ_BE.exe to DayZ_BE.exe.disabled.**
